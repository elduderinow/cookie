## What is the coockie clicker game?
It is a fun game where you need to get as many cookies as possible by clicking on the coockie itself and/or buy power ups to gain cookies per second.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to learn to handle DOM elements, and incrementing the right amount in JS. Also learn to develop a page with HTML/CSS.

## FUNCTIONALITIES
- Main cookie is clickable and counting +1.
- 5 power ups with different bonusses.
- The price for each of the bonusses increases each time it is bought by 20%.
- The upgrades displays how many upgrades per bonus have been bought.
- Added some custom made backgrounds and icons to make it more appealing.

## THE PROJECT
I thought it was going to be more difficult to manage, I had a fun time creating it. I think the requirements for this exercise after 1,5 months is a bit too low level.

Ofcourse I can always add in my own crazy code to do more crazy stuff, will think about that.
